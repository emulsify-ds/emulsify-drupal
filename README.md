### Committing Changes

To facilitate automatic semantic release versioning, we utilize the [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) standard through Commitizen. Follow these steps when commiting your work to ensure semantic release can version correctly.

1. Stage your changes, ensuring they encompass exactly what you wish to change, no more.
2. Run the `commit` script via `yarn commit` or `npm run commit` and follow the prompts to craft the perfect commit message.
3. Your commit message will be used to create the changelog for the next version that includes that commit.
